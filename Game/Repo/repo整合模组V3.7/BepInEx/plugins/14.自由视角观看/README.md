# Do you get bored spectating your friends?
This mod lets you fly around while spectating!

## Keybinds
**Z** - Toggles freecam (Can only be toggled while spectating)  
**W/A/S/D** - Moves forward, left, back, and right respectively  
**Jump/E** - Moves up  
**Crouch/Q** - Moves down  
**Shift** - Doubles movement speed  
**Middle Mouse** - Teleports your camera back to whoever you're spectating

## Note
When freecam is enabled, this mod disables the jump button's ability to cycle to the next player. Instead, youâ€™ll need to use the designated keybinds, typically left click and right click.
